# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest `main` branch is actively supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within DevFlow, please do NOT open a public issue. Instead, please report it via one of the following methods:

- **Email**: Send a detailed report to `security@example.com` (Replace with actual contact)
- **GitHub**: Use the "Private Vulnerability Reporting" feature if enabled.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix.

## Our Commitment

We take security seriously and will work to resolve issues as quickly as possible.
